To-do tier list

Soon:
- Add character unique attributes definitions (right now only Ganondorf has them, for testing)
- Add drop down menus and human readable names for the various constants in hitbox events / other events
- Fix subaction/goto follow so that it finds locations even if they are not at the start of a script, and also selects the event
- Document the UI, etc

Later:
- Implement swapping animations between subactions
- Option to open and save from an iso directly?
- Un-hardcode gui dimensions and clean things up

Eventually:
- Move logic tables and FSMs are in the dol so they are a future project
