To-do tier list

Soon:
- Add drop down menus and human readable names for the various constants in hitbox events / other events
- Fix subaction/goto follow so that it finds locations even if they are not at the start of a script, and also selects the event
- Document the UI, etc

Later:
- Add ability to modify projectile data
- Clean up unique attribute names, right now they're scraped from CH
- Expand unique attrib. config files to define an arbitrary number of tables per file, maybe projectiles too
- Implement swapping animations between subactions
- Option to open and save from an iso directly?
- Un-hardcode gui dimensions and clean things up

Eventually:
- Move logic tables and FSMs are in the dol so they are a future project
